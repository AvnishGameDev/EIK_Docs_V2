# Token based Voice Chat with EOS

<Callout type="warning">
 If you want just basic voice chat in your game with matches, we suggest you to use the [Lobby based Voice Chat](/multiplayer/voicechat/lobbybased) instead of this. This is for advanced users who want to control the voice chat in their game as they want and hence also requires a bit of setup
 </Callout>

## Setting up the Voice Chat

`Voice Room Name` - The name of the voice room that you want to join. For instance, if you have a game similar to Pubg or Fortnite, where there are 100 players with teams of 4, then you can have 25 voice rooms with 4 players each. This will allow you to have a voice room for each team.

`Player Name` - The name of the player that you want to join the voice room with. This is the name that will be displayed in the voice room.

`Client IP` - The IP of the client. You can use **10.0.0.1** as the default value if you don't want to pass the IP. If you pass the IP, EOS will connect you to nearest available voice server.
