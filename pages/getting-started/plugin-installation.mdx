5. Restart the **Unreal Engine** editor.

Done! You've successfully installed the plugin.

## Source Edition

<Callout type="warning">
    Because the source version of the plugin is not compiled, you will need to compile it yourself before using it in your project. This is why you need a C++ project to use the source version of the plugin.

1. Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/betidestudio/EOSIntegrationKit) either using the `git clone` command or by downloading the repository as a ZIP archive.

2. Once downloaded, extract the contents of the ZIP archive to the `Plugins` folder of your Unreal Engine project.

3. Download the 1.16.4 [EOS SDK](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/en-US/) from the Epic Games website. Download the SDK for the platform you are developing for.

- **Windows** : C SDK
- **Mac** : C SDK
- **Linux** : C SDK
- **Android** : Android SDK
- **iOS** : iOS SDK

4. Now we need to copy the SDK files to the plugin folder. The SDK files are located in the `SDK` folder of the downloaded ZIP archive. The SDK files are different for each platform. Let me guide you through the process.

### C SDK 

- Extract the downloaded ZIP archive and then copy the elements of the `SDK` folder to the `ThirdParty/EIKSDK` folder of the plugin.

### Android SDK

<Callout type="warning">
    The current Android implementation of EIK only supports Android API Level 34 and above because of Google's new API updates, we are trying to make the plugin work on older Android versions as well, but till then, make sure you have the latest Gradle (Tested on 8.5), Android SDK 34 and above, and NDK 26c and above.
    Make sure you update the SDK/NDK location in your environment variables and Project Settings.
</Callout>

Starting EOS SDK V1.16.2, Epic Games doesn't provide the `libEOSSDK.so` files for Android. So, we have to extract them from the SDK ourselves. Let's go through the steps.

- From the unzipped SDK folder, navigate to `SDK\Bin\Android\static-stdc++\aar` and extract the `eossdk-StaticSTDC-release.aar` file using an archive manager like 7-Zip.

- Now from the extracted files, navigate to `eossdk-StaticSTDC-release\jni` and copy all the folders and files to the `ThirdParty/EIKSDK/Bin/Android` folder of the plugin. The folder should look like this :

- Copy the **includes** from the extracted files to the `Source/ThirdParty/EIKSDK` folder of the plugin. The new folder structure should look like this :

- Then go back to `SDK\Bin\Android\static-stdc++\aar` and copy `eossdk-StaticSTDC-release.aar` to `Plugin\Source\ThirdParty\EIKSDK\Bin` and rename the file as `eos-sdk.aar`

### iOS SDK

- Extract the downloaded ZIP archive and then copy the elements of the `SDK` folder to the `ThirdParty/EIKSDK` folder of the plugin, same as the C SDK.

To verify that the SDK files are copied correctly, the folder structure of `ThirdParty/EIKSDK/Bin/IOS` should look like this :

### Back to the unified steps

5. Now right click on the `.uproject` file of your project and select `Generate Visual Studio project files`.

![picture 14](../../images/7023f1e0254176000c527a99c1c377e29923ba21ada1f3b39f9401e12b44ca9f.png)  

6. Open the generated `.sln` file in Visual Studio and compile the project.

7. Once compiled, open the **Plugins** window in the **Unreal Engine** editor and enable the plugin by checking the box next to `EOS Integration Kit`.

8. Restart the **Unreal Engine** editor.

Done! You've successfully installed the plugin.
