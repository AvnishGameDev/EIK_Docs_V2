# Friends with EOS Integration Kit

Not everyone has a ton of friends, but with EIK, you can make sure the ones you do have never miss a game! (Thanks to AI for the joke, now you decide if they are funny or not)

<Callout type="warning"> 
    According to [Epic's documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-account-services/eos-friends-interface), please note that functions will only return friends who have played the game at least once and have given their consent. Consent is either give upon game purchase or when a player signs in to an application using Epic Account Services (EAS) and allows EAS access to their account data.
