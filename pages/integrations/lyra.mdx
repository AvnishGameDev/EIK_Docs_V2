Okay, time to integrate [Lyra](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/lyra) with EOS Integration Kit (EIK). This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Lyra with EIK so that you can take advantage of both plugins in your project.

### Important Note for Marketplace Users

If you have purchased Lyra from the Unreal Engine Marketplace, you can download the merged version of Lyra and EIK from the [Betide Studio License Manager](https://app.betide.studio/). This version of Lyra includes the necessary changes to work with EIK out of the box.
