# Anti-Cheat with EOS Integration Kit

EOS Integration Kit has a built-in anti-cheat system which is **Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC)**. EAC was a third-party anti-cheat system that was acquired by Epic Games and integrated into the EOS SDK. This integration allows developers to easily add anti-cheat functionality to their games without having to worry about implementing it themselves.

## Setting up Easy Anti-Cheat

To set up Easy Anti-Cheat with EOS Integration Kit, let's assume that we have two leves in our game: `MainMenu` and `Gameplay`. All the below steps are to be done in the `Gameplay` and the respective blueprints have to be used. So for example, PlayerController of the game level will be the Controller I am referring to in the following steps:

### 1. Setting up Game Mode

First of all, OnPostLogin event of the GameMode has to be overridden. In this event, we have to call the Register Client For Anti-Cheat blueprint node from Anti-Cheat Server and pass the PlayerController as the parameter along with Client Product ID. This will register the player with the anti-cheat system.

### 2. Setting up Player Controller

There are basically three things that have to be done in the PlayerController blueprint. Let's see them one by one.

Setup Event BeginPlay to call RegisterAntiCheatClient from Anti-Cheat Client. This will initialize the anti-cheat system for the player. Make sure this is done locally only.

Second sub step would be to register calls from EOS SDK which would inform you to forward some messages to the anti-cheat server. Bind to OnSendMessageToServer event and call a new custom event like in the below graph which will forward to the game server.

Create a custom event to receive messages from the server and forward them to the anti-cheat client.

Make it like the functions below->

### 3. Generate Anti-Cheat Files

Now the code setup is done, we have to generate the anti-cheat files. For this, we have to run the GenerateAntiCheatFiles command from the console. This will generate the required files in the AntiCheat folder.
