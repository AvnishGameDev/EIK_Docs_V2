# Voice Chat with Epic Online Services

Voice chat is a feature that allows players to communicate with each other in real-time using a microphone. This feature is especially useful in multiplayer games where players need to coordinate their actions or simply want to chat with each other. Epic Online Services (EOS) provides a voice chat system that you can integrate into your game to enable this feature.

There are two different ways to implement voice chat in your game using EOS:

1. **Lobby Voice Chat**: This is voice chat that is available to all players in a lobby. You have to enable this when creating the [lobby session](/multiplayer/matchmaking/lobbies)
2. **Token-Based Voice Chat**: This is voice chat that is not tied to a specific session or lobby. You can use this to implement voice chat in any custom scenario.
